<article><header><h4>Design Together</h4></header>

  <section><p><em class="large_em">Together, we have the skill, talent, and passion it takes to build a sustainable future. Modular Village connects people who share a common project vision to plan and execute their vision. DIY communities have already changed the world by sharing their individual projects. Modular village is a way for DIYers--professionals and laypeople--from all walks of life to come together on complex, macro-scale projects.</em></p>

  <h4>How does it work?</h4> 
  <p>Anyone can set up a project proposal. All it takes is a title and a description. Want to build a farm? Describe your vision. Want to make your urban condominium off-the-grid? What do you have so far? Fill in everything that you know about the project--the project vision, the steps involved, the materials, the budget, the human resources, etc. Also communicate your needs--the weak points in your project plan.</p>
  <p>Now comes the fun part. Hit the "publish" button and open up your project to the design intelligence of the open-source community. These are everyday people who are excited about your project vision and want to see it become a reality. They may want to build the project themselves, or "fork" it so they can cater it to their own needs.</p>
